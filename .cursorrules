# RetailerBoost Website Guidelines

## Language & Spelling
- Always use **US English spellings** (e.g., "optimization" not "optimisation", "color" not "colour", "analyze" not "analyse")
- Common US spelling reminders:
  - -ize endings (optimize, customize, maximize)
  - -or endings (color, favor, behavior)
  - -er endings (center, meter)
  - -og endings (catalog, dialog)
  - -ment without e (judgment, acknowledgment)
  - -ense endings (defense, license)

## Tone & Style
- **Limited emoji use** - Our ICP (enterprise retailers, PPC managers) expects professional communication
- Emojis are acceptable sparingly in UI elements (e.g., Before/After cards) but avoid overuse
- Keep copy professional, clear, and benefit-focused
- Focus on outcomes: orders generated, revenue, ROI

## Brand Voice
- Confident but not arrogant
- Technical credibility without jargon overload
- Emphasize the zero-risk, pay-on-results model
- Ada is an AI agent, not a tool or software

## Technical
- All pages should use the dark theme with consistent CSS variables
- DM Sans is the primary font family
- Primary color: #247CFF (blue)
- Background: #0B1314 (dark)
